I'll help you set up InsForge as your backend platform by following these steps:

## Step 1: Get Backend Metadata
- Use MCP to retrieve your backend metadata and anon key
- Confirm your API configuration is working properly

## Step 2: Download React Template  
- Use the `download-template` MCP tool to get a pre-configured React starter
- This will include proper InsForge SDK setup and configuration

## Step 3: Install Dependencies
- Install the InsForge SDK: `npm install @insforge/sdk@latest`
- Set up any additional dependencies needed for your project

## Step 4: Configure Project Structure
- Set up the InsForge client with your base URL and anon key
- Create basic project structure with authentication and database examples

## Step 5: Test Integration
- Test database connection with a simple table creation
- Verify authentication flow is working
- Ensure all services (database, auth, storage, AI) are accessible

This will give you a fully functional InsForge backend setup ready for development. Would you like me to proceed with this plan?

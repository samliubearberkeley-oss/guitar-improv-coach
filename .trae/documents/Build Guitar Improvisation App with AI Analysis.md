## Implementation Plan for Guitar Improvisation App

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. **Clean up existing code** - Remove demo components and prepare clean slate
2. **Configure Insforge AI** - Set up AI integration for musical analysis
3. **Create audio processing module** - Implement Web Audio API wrapper

### Phase 2: Core Audio Engine
1. **Implement pitch detection** - Build real-time pitch detection algorithm
2. **Create note mapping** - Map detected pitches to guitar fretboard
3. **Add audio buffering** - Store note sequences for analysis

### Phase 3: Musical Analysis
1. **Build scale detector** - Track in-scale vs out-of-scale notes
2. **Implement timing analyzer** - Measure rhythmic accuracy
3. **Create pitch stability analyzer** - Evaluate vibrato and bends
4. **Build style matcher** - Genre-specific pattern recognition

### Phase 4: UI Components
1. **Create fretboard visualization** - Interactive guitar fretboard
2. **Build control panel** - Style, key, tempo selection
3. **Implement live feedback** - Real-time analysis display
4. **Create results screen** - Post-session scores and feedback

### Phase 5: AI Integration
1. **Connect to Insforge AI** - Send analysis data for musical evaluation
2. **Implement scoring engine** - Calculate weighted scores
3. **Generate practice feedback** - Create actionable suggestions

### Phase 6: Polish & Optimize
1. **Apply dark theme** - Professional dark UI design
2. **Optimize performance** - Ensure low-latency audio processing
3. **Add error handling** - Graceful handling of audio issues
4. **Test across browsers** - Ensure compatibility

The app will analyze guitar improvisation based on musicality rather than just hitting "correct" notes, providing intelligent feedback to help guitarists improve their improvisational skills.

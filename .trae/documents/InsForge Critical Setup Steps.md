I'll complete the three critical setup steps for InsForge:

## Step 1: Download Template
Use the `download-template` MCP tool to download a pre-configured React template with InsForge integration. This will create a new project structure with your backend URL and anon key already configured.

## Step 2: Install SDK
Run `npm install @insforge/sdk@latest` to install the latest InsForge SDK package.

## Step 3: Initialize Client
The template will come with the SDK client pre-configured, but I'll verify the client initialization with your backend URL and anon key.

**Backend Details from Documentation:**
- API Base URL: `https://35nqh7qy.us-west.insforge.app`
- Framework: React (based on your current project)

Let me execute these steps to get your InsForge backend properly integrated.

Based on the current state and your request to modify the fretboard at http://localhost:3000/, here are the enhancement options:

## Current State Analysis
The fretboard currently matches your reference image with:
- Orange-brown wood background (#964B00)
- White grid lines for strings and frets
- String labels: e, B, G, D, A, E (top to bottom)
- Fret numbers 1-16 at bottom
- Grey circles for scale notes, purple for active notes
- Beige inlay dots at standard positions

## Enhancement Options

### 1. Interactive Features
- **Hover Effects**: Add subtle glow when hovering over frets
- **Click Detection**: Make frets clickable for chord building
- **Note Preview**: Show note names on hover before playing
- **Scale Highlighting**: Highlight entire scale patterns

### 2. Visual Improvements
- **String Vibration Animation**: Animate strings when notes are played
- **Note Trail Effects**: Show fading trail for recently played notes
- **Dynamic Inlays**: Make inlay dots more prominent or glowing
- **Fretboard Texture**: Add wood grain texture for realism

### 3. Functional Enhancements
- **Chord Display**: Show chord names when multiple notes are played
- **Scale Mode Switcher**: Toggle between different scales (pentatonic, blues, etc.)
- **Capo Simulation**: Add virtual capo functionality
- **Tuning Options**: Support for alternate tunings

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- **Note Caching**: Cache note calculations for better performance
- **Animation Optimization**: Use CSS transforms for smoother animations
- **Responsive Design**: Better mobile/tablet support

## Implementation Priority
1. **Interactive hover effects** (quick win, high impact)
2. **String vibration animation** (visual appeal)
3. **Scale highlighting improvements** (educational value)
4. **Chord detection and display** (advanced feature)

Would you like me to implement any of these enhancements, or do you have specific changes in mind?
